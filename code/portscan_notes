Gerneral:
  see https://github.com/snort3/snort3/blob/master/doc/port_scan.txt

  Types of portscans: (single host scans)
    TCP scan
    UPD scan
    IP scan

  Portsweeps (TCP/UDP)
  Filtered scans (stealth)
  

Keep track of connections, count packets not part of connections

single host scan (single source)
-> count ports hit per host in timewindow

single host scan (distributed)
-> count ports hit per host in timewindow

Portsweeps
-> count hosts hit per port

considerations:
  do not overwhelm either if the other scan is ongoing!
