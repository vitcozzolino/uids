Introduction / (Motivation)

Why IDS are important
Resource constrained
IoT stuff 
IoT botnets - sensitive private data Alexa, Doorbell cameras, smart devices etc
Unikernels as a way to run single purpose applications fast

Thesis explores the advantages and disavantages of running IDS via unikernels (faster, easiser to deploy etc)
IDS constrained to Portscan and DoS detection



Background
  Unikernel
  IDS
  Portscans and detection
  DoS and detection

Related work
  CEPDIS & CEPDIS thesis
  Snort
  ClickOS
  Bauer thesis (Portscan detection eval)
  IncludeOS firewall benchmarking

Implementation
  IncludeOS and what it provides
    Conntrack
    Architecture/Network stack
  Our Implementation
    Portscan detection threshold based (based on snorts ideas)


Evaluation
  Available datasets for evaluation (that one paper) 
  vs Snort (background taffic, describe testbed etc.)
    Performance and accuracy
  vs CEPDIS (if possible same tests)
    performance mostly
    Build in forwarding/firewalling?
  
Conclusion
  Interpret evaluation results
  Furture work (Nacl based rules? Full ids ipv6 support gateway ...)
  It does (or does not) make sense to deploy IDS as unikernel based single purpose applications
